Cardiovascular Risk Classification Policy

1. Purpose
This policy describes how to automatically classify patients into one of three cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk categories — Low, Medium, or High — based on structured clinical and lifestyle data.

2. Data Requirements
The system requires the following information for each patient:
Age in years.
Biological sex ("male" or "female").
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements in mmHg.
Blood levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, measured in mg/dL.
Smoking history, classified as "never", "former", or "current" smoker.
Diagnosis status for diabetes (true or false).
Family history of cardiovascular disease (true or false).
Current use of blood pressure medications (true or false).
Current use of cholesterol-lowering medications (true or false).

3. Handling Missing Data
If numerical data is missing, it must be filled in using the median value observed in the training dataset.
If categorical data is missing, it must be filled in using the most frequent value observed in the training dataset.
If critical fields such as age, systolic blood pressure, or diabetes status are missing, the case must be flagged for manual review.

4. Risk Classification Logic
The risk classification process follows a strict evaluation order.

A patient must be classified as High Risk if any of the following conditions are met:
The patient is 60 years or older and has a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher.
The LDL cholesterol level is 160 mg/dL or higher.
The patient is a current smoker.
The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes.
The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease.

If none of the High Risk conditions are met, the patient must be classified as Medium Risk if any of the following conditions are met:
The patient is between 45 and 59 years old (inclusive).
The systolic blood pressure is between 130 mmHg and 139 mmHg inclusive.
The LDL cholesterol level is between 130 mg/dL and 159 mg/dL inclusive.
The patient is a former smoker.
The HDL cholesterol level is less than 40 mg/dL.

If neither the High Risk nor Medium Risk conditions are met, the patient must be classified as Low Risk.

Conditions must be evaluated sequentially, and once a patient meets criteria for a given risk level, evaluation must stop.

5. Output Requirements
Each patient must be assigned a risk level of "Low", "Medium", or "High".
