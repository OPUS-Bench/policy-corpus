Cross-Border Fraud Detection Policy (Concise, Natural Language)
Purpose: Identify and manage risks associated with card transactions that involve foreign countries, currency exchange, or regulatory concerns.

1. Cross-Border Activity Checks
Flag any transaction made from a country that doesn’t match the card’s issuing country, unless the user has a history of transacting there.
If a user makes three or more international transactions within 24 hours, across at least two different currencies, and spends over €1,000, review unless travel has been confirmed.
Transactions in unusual or exotic currencies that the user hasn’t used before should raise a risk flag.

2. Jurisdiction and Regulation Flags
Automatically block transactions linked to countries under international sanctions (e.g., OFAC, EU, UN lists).
If a transaction originates from a country considered high-risk for money laundering, and the amount is over €200, flag it for review.
Payments to offshore financial centers (like the Cayman Islands or Seychelles) by personal cardholders without business profiles should trigger extra due diligence.

3. User Identity and Location Consistency
Hold cross-border transactions if the user’s identity verification (e.g., ID or address) is incomplete.
If a user claims residence in one country but repeatedly makes transactions from another—especially if that country has strict financial controls—ask for justification.

4. Merchant and Platform Risks
Be cautious with foreign merchants in high-risk categories (such as gift card sellers, resale platforms, or unregulated crypto services). These should increase the transaction’s risk score.
If a user repeatedly sends money to unlicensed or unregulated financial platforms based abroad, flag the activity for anti-money laundering (AML) review.

5. Thresholds and Exceptions
All cross-border transactions over €10,000 must be reported and reviewed for regulatory compliance.
Low-value international transactions within trusted regions (like SEPA, EEA, or between the US and Canada) can be allowed with less scrutiny—unless other risks are detected.

6. Risk Handling
Each rule adds to a total fraud risk score.
Low risk (0–30): Allow, but monitor.
Medium risk (31–60): Flag for manual review.
High risk (>60): Block and notify the compliance team.
