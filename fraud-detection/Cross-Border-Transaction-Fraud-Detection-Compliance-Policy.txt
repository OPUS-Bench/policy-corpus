Cross-Border Transaction Fraud Detection & Compliance Policy
Objective: Detect potentially fraudulent or non-compliant card transactions involving transborder activities, high-risk jurisdictions, or regulatory violations.

1. Cross-Border Transaction Risk Indicators
Rule 1.1: Inconsistent Geo-IP and Issuing Country
If a transaction is initiated from a country other than the card’s issuing country, and the user has not previously transacted in that region, assign a moderate risk score and verify the transaction context.

Rule 1.2: Transborder Spending Surge
If the user performs 3 or more cross-border transactions within 24 hours, across multiple currency zones, and the total spend exceeds €1,000, escalate for review unless travel was declared or supported by location data.

Rule 1.3: Currency Risk Profiling
If the transaction is in a rarely used or exotic currency (e.g., KZT, XOF), and it is not linked to known travel or business behavior, assign a high transaction risk score.

2. Jurisdictional Red Flags
Rule 2.1: Sanctioned or Watchlisted Countries
If the transaction involves a merchant or IP address in a jurisdiction under OFAC, EU, or UN sanctions, automatically block and escalate to compliance.

Rule 2.2: High-Risk AML Jurisdictions
If the transaction originates from or is routed through high-risk jurisdictions (as defined by FATF lists), flag for manual compliance review, especially if amount > €200.

Rule 2.3: Offshore Service Providers
If the recipient is registered in a known offshore finance center (e.g., BVI, Seychelles, Cayman Islands), and the cardholder is a retail user with no business profile, trigger enhanced due diligence (EDD).

3. Regulatory Mismatches & Identity Gaps
Rule 3.1: KYC Profile Incomplete
If a cross-border transaction is attempted from a user missing key KYC fields (e.g., verified address, ID document), deny or hold the transaction and request re-verification.

Rule 3.2: Inconsistent Nationality and Usage
If a cardholder declared residence in Country A, but is transacting repeatedly from Country B (especially for high-value items), and Country B enforces stricter capital controls or reporting, flag and request justification.

4. Payment Channel and Merchant Profiling
Rule 4.1: Cross-Border Online Merchants in Grey Zones
If the merchant is cross-border and belongs to a category often linked to laundering or synthetic ID fraud (e.g., digital goods resale, gift cards, shell e-commerce), apply a risk multiplier to the transaction score.

Rule 4.2: Repeated Payments to Unregulated Foreign Entities
If the cardholder sends recurring payments to an unlicensed financial service or crypto exchange registered abroad, and the platform is not in your regulated whitelist, flag for AML review.

5. Legal and Compliance Overrides
Rule 5.1: Mandatory Escalation Rules
Any cross-border transaction over €10,000 must be logged and subject to reporting thresholds (e.g., under EU AMLD5 or FinCEN CTR rules).

Rule 5.2: Intra-Region Compliance Exceptions
Exempt low-value cross-border transactions within the EEA, US-Canada, or SEPA zone from enhanced scrutiny, unless other risk signals apply.

6. Risk Scoring & Escalation
Assign each rule a weighted risk score based on regulatory sensitivity and historical fraud correlation.

Composite score thresholds:
0–30: Accept with monitoring
31–60: Flag for compliance review
>60: Block transaction and initiate EDD / SAR process

Use country-specific policies to override generic rules (e.g., tighter scrutiny for cards issued in high-fraud regions).

7. Logs and Audit Trail
Ensure every flagged cross-border transaction includes:
Geo-IP location
Merchant jurisdiction
Currency conversion path
AML/KYC status of user
Sanctions or watchlist match flags
