Card Transaction Fraud Detection Policy (Advanced Version)
Purpose: Detect and flag potentially fraudulent card transactions based on behavioral anomalies, velocity patterns, location discrepancies, risk categories, and historical deviations.

1. Advanced Velocity Rules
Rule 1.1: Multi-Tier Temporal Velocity

If a card is used:
≥ 3 times in under 1 minute, or
≥ 6 times in under 5 minutes, or
≥ 10 times in under 10 minutes,
then assign increasing risk scores (10, 20, 30 respectively), and flag the card if the total exceeds 30.

Rule 1.2: Cross-Merchant Velocity Spike
If 3 or more transactions from the same card occur at distinct merchants within a 3-minute window, flag the transaction group for possible automation abuse or testing of stolen credentials.

Rule 1.3: Interleaved Declines and Approvals
If more than 2 declined transactions occur within a 5-minute window, followed by an approved transaction, assign a high fraud suspicion score (35).

2. Geolocation Anomalies
Rule 2.1: Improbable Geolocation Shift
If two transactions from the same card originate from locations more than 500 km apart and occur within 30 minutes, flag the card for possible cloning.

Rule 2.2: Geofencing Violation
If a transaction occurs outside the customer’s usual country or region without prior travel notice, and no recent login or transaction was registered from that region, increase the fraud score by 25.

3. Behavioral and Profile Deviations
Rule 3.1: Transaction Time Deviation
If the transaction occurs at an unusual time (±2 hours outside of the cardholder's typical transaction windows), and the transaction amount is greater than the daily average, increase fraud score by 15.

Rule 3.2: Unusual Merchant Category
If the transaction is from a merchant in a category not seen in the last 90 days for the user, and the amount is ≥ €100, increase the fraud score by 10.

4. Transaction Context & Amount Irregularities
Rule 4.1: High Amount Deviation
If the transaction amount exceeds 5× the user’s median transaction amount, flag for review unless it's a recurring or previously whitelisted merchant.

Rule 4.2: New Address or Device for High-Value Purchase
If a transaction > €500 is made from a new device or new shipping address, and neither was verified, flag for manual review.

5. Device, Network, and Environment Risks
Rule 5.1: Device Fingerprint Mismatch
If the current device fingerprint does not match any known trusted device, and the transaction amount exceeds €100, increase fraud score by 20.

Rule 5.2: Risky Network Indicators
If the transaction is made from a VPN, anonymized proxy, or TOR, flag regardless of amount, unless this behavior is previously profiled and marked trusted.

6. Account and Card Status Awareness
Rule 6.1: Dormancy Activation
If a card was inactive for >30 days, and a transaction occurs above €200, flag unless preceded by a verified login or profile update.

Rule 6.2: Historical Suspicion

If the cardholder reported phishing or account takeover in the past 7 days, auto-flag all new transactions for escalation.
7. Composite Scoring and Threshold Logic
Each rule contributes to a composite fraud risk score, scaled between 0 and 100.

Risk levels:
Score 0–40: Low Risk – Approve transaction
Score 41–70: Medium Risk – Send for review
Score >70: High Risk – Block transaction, notify fraud team

Risk scores decay over time for ongoing monitoring (e.g., 10% per hour) if no further suspicious activity is observed.
