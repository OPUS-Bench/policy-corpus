Acme Corp – Discount Approval Policy
Effective Date: January 1, 2025
Scope: This policy governs all discount approvals for customer deals submitted by the sales team. It applies to Sales Representatives, Sales Managers, and Finance Officers.

Objective: To balance sales agility with financial discipline by defining clear thresholds and responsibilities for approving customer discounts.

1. Discount Limits by Customer Tier
Sales Representatives may approve discounts based on the customer’s classification in the CRM system. Customers are grouped into three tiers: Tier 1 (Enterprise), Tier 2 (SMB), and Tier 3 (Startups). The maximum allowable discount without further approval is 20% for Tier 1 customers, 15% for Tier 2 customers, and 10% for Tier 3 customers.

2. Deal Size Restrictions
Discounts are further limited by the size of the deal. For deals under $5,000, the representative may approve discounts up to their tier-based maximum. For deals between $5,000 and $25,000, any discount exceeding 10% requires approval from a Sales Manager, regardless of the customer tier. For deals over $25,000, Finance approval is required for any discount above 5%.

3. Profit Margin Requirements
No discount shall be granted if the resulting gross margin falls below 30%, unless explicitly approved by the Vice President of Sales. The gross margin must be computed using the CPQ tool’s automatic calculation, factoring in current pricing and cost structures.

4. Approval Workflow
Sales Managers may approve discounts up to 25%, provided the gross margin remains at or above 30%. Any discount above 25%, or any case where the gross margin drops below 35%, must also be approved by a Finance Officer. Additionally, if the deal includes a bundled offer involving hardware, Finance must co-approve regardless of margin.

5. Automatic Approval Criteria
A discount may be automatically approved without human intervention if all the following conditions are met: the discount is within the representative’s tier limit, the customer has no overdue invoices in the past 12 months, the quote uses the standard pricing template, and no custom contract terms are included.

6. Exceptions Handling
Any discount request that does not meet the criteria outlined in this policy must be submitted as an exception using the Discount Justification Form available in Salesforce. All exceptions are reviewed on a weekly basis by the Deal Desk Committee, which may grant or deny approval based on strategic or financial considerations.
