Synthetic Air Pollution Compliance Policy for Airplanes (SAPCPA-2025)

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: January 1, 2025
Scope: All commercial aircraft operating flights that depart from, arrive at, or transit through the jurisdiction of the Global Aviation Environmental Authority (GAEA).

Section 1 – Emissions Monitoring
1.1. Every aircraft operator must monitor and record CO₂ emissions and fuel consumption for each flight using approved fuel measurement methods (fuel uplift, fuel flow meters, or block-off estimates).

1.2. Monitoring data must include:

Aircraft ID

Flight number

Departure and arrival airports

Flight time

Fuel type and volume

CO₂ emissions (calculated using standard emission factors)

1.3. Emissions reports must be:

Submitted annually by March 31st for the preceding calendar year.

Verified by an accredited third-party verifier.

Retained for a minimum of 7 years.

Section 2 – Emissions Limits
2.1. Aircraft models certified on or after Jan 1, 2025, must meet the following per-seat CO₂ emissions standard:

≤ 85 grams CO₂ per Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK)

2.2. Aircraft engines must not exceed the following certified limits for Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):

≤ 15 grams NOx per kilonewton of rated thrust during the Landing and Takeoff (LTO) cycle.

2.3. Aircraft must not emit Visible Smoke or exceed Particulate Matter (PM) thresholds as follows:

≤ 20 mg PM / kg fuel during LTO operations.

Section 3 – Carbon Offsetting Requirements (CORSIA Compliance)
3.1. Operators emitting more than 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually from international flights must:

Participate in the GAEA Offsetting Mechanism.

Purchase offset credits equivalent to their excess emissions above their baseline allocation (average of 2019–2020 CO₂ emissions).

3.2. Operators may reduce offset obligations using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with a verified lifecycle reduction ≥ 70% vs Jet-A.

Section 4 – Sustainable Fuel Incentives
4.1. A SAF credit shall be granted when:

SAF is blended at ≥ 10% volume on any flight.

The SAF meets GAEA sustainability criteria and is certified by an approved body.

4.2. Each liter of SAF used reduces offsetting obligation by:

2.5 kg of CO₂-equivalent, if the SAF lifecycle reduction is ≥ 80%.

Section 5 – Ground Operations Emissions
5.1. Operators must avoid auxiliary power unit (APU) use when Fixed Electrical Ground Power (FEGP) is available, except under operational emergency.

5.2. All Ground Support Equipment (GSE) operating in GAEA airports must be electric or hybrid by 2027.

Section 6 – Fleet Compliance
6.1. Operators may not introduce new aircraft into service unless the aircraft type:

Has been certified under the GAEA 2025 CO₂ standard.

Meets the NOx and PM limits in Section 2.

6.2. Existing aircraft that do not comply with Section 2 must:

Be retrofitted by 2030, or

Be phased out of service before 2032.

Section 7 – Compliance & Penalties
7.1. Failure to comply results in:

Administrative penalties of up to $100 per metric ton of unreported or unoffset CO₂.

Suspension of route rights for continuous or willful violations.

7.2. GAEA may conduct random audits and on-site inspections.

7.3. Operators may appeal compliance decisions within 30 days of notice.

Section 8 – Definitions
Flight: Any aircraft movement from gate departure to gate arrival.

Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK): One paying passenger transported one kilometer.

SAF: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, as defined by ISO 14067.

Offset Credit: A verified emission reduction unit from an approved GHG registry.
