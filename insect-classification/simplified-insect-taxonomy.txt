Simplified Insect Classification Policy (Morphology-Centric)
Objective: Determine if an animal is an insect and assign it to a common insect order based on visible traits. Developmental mode (metamorphosis) is considered implicitly, not as a separate step.

Step 1: Is it an insect?
An animal is an insect if it has:
- A body divided into three parts: head, thorax, abdomen
- Six legs, all attached to the thorax
- One pair of antennae
- Often wings (1 or 2 pairs), though some may lack them
- An external skeleton (exoskeleton)

If all true → classify as Insect
If not → Not an insect

Step 2: Assign to a Sub-Category (Order)
Use visible features to classify the insect into one of the common orders:

🪲 Coleoptera (Beetles)
- Forewings are hardened into a shell (elytra)
- Wings meet in a straight line down the back
- Chewing mouthparts
- Compact or oval body shapes

🦋 Lepidoptera (Butterflies, Moths)
- Two pairs of wings covered in tiny scales
- Long coiled mouthpart (proboscis) for sipping
- Wings often colorful or patterned
- Often seen flying during the day (butterflies) or night (moths)

🪰 Diptera (Flies, Mosquitoes)
- One pair of wings; second pair reduced to small knobs (halteres)
- Eyes often large and compound
- Mouthparts may be sponging or piercing
- Fast, agile fliers

🐝 Hymenoptera (Bees, Wasps, Ants)
- Two pairs of clear, membranous wings (some wingless like ants)
- Narrow waist between thorax and abdomen
- Often social, forming colonies
- May have stingers or chewing parts

🪳 Hemiptera (True Bugs)
- Mouthparts form a beak for piercing/sucking
- Wings often half-leathery, half-membranous
- Held flat over the body or in an "X" shape
- Includes stink bugs, aphids, cicadas

🦗 Orthoptera (Grasshoppers, Crickets, Katydids)
- Large hind legs for jumping
- Chewing mouthparts
- Often produce sound (stridulation)
- Wings fold like a fan over the back

🐉 Odonata (Dragonflies, Damselflies)
- Long, slender body
- Two pairs of long, clear wings
- Large compound eyes
- Often seen near water; strong fliers

✅ Example:
Observed Traits:
6 legs, 3 body segments
Two clear pairs of wings
Narrow waist
Active during the day, visits flowers
Classification: 
→ Insect → Hymenoptera (likely a bee or wasp)
