Insect Classification Policy
Objective: To determine whether an animal is an insect and, if so, classify it into a relevant insect order using observable characteristics related to morphology and development.

Step 1: Determine if the animal is an insect
To be classified as an insect (Class Insecta), the animal must meet all of the following morphological criteria:

Body segmentation:
  The body is clearly divided into three main regions:
  Head (with sensory organs and mouthparts)
  Thorax (with legs and wings)
  Abdomen (housing reproductive and digestive organs)

Limbs:
  It has exactly three pairs of legs (total of six legs), all attached to the thorax.

Antennae:
  It possesses one pair of antennae, typically used for sensing.

Exoskeleton:
  The body is covered by a hard external skeleton made of chitin.

Eyes:
Most insects have compound eyes (made of many lenses), although some may also have simple eyes (ocelli).

Wings (optional but common):
  Most adult insects have one or two pairs of wings, though some are wingless.

If all criteria are met, the animal is classified as an insect.
If not, the animal is not an insect (possibly another arthropod such as an arachnid or crustacean).

Step 2: Identify type of metamorphosis
Once confirmed as an insect, identify how the insect develops from birth to adult:

A. Complete Metamorphosis (Holometabolous)
Involves four distinct life stages:
  Egg
  Larva (worm-like, active feeding stage)
  Pupa (inactive transformation stage)
  Adult

The larva looks completely different from the adult.

B. Incomplete Metamorphosis (Hemimetabolous)
Involves three life stages:
  Egg
  Nymph (small version of the adult, often without wings)
  Adult

The nymph resembles the adult, and there is no pupal stage.

Step 3: Determine the Insect Order
Based on a combination of morphology and development type, the insect can be classified into one of several common orders:

3.1 If the insect undergoes COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS:
Order Coleoptera (Beetles)
  Hardened forewings (elytra) forming a protective shell
Chewing mouthparts
Variety of body sizes and shapes

Order Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths)
  Two pairs of wings covered in tiny scales
  Long, coiled proboscis (for sipping nectar)
  Caterpillar larval stage

Order Diptera (Flies, Mosquitoes)
  One pair of wings, second pair reduced to halteres (balance organs)
  Sucking, sponging, or piercing mouthparts
  Maggot-like larvae

Order Hymenoptera (Bees, Wasps, Ants)

Two pairs of membranous wings (or wingless in ants)
  Narrow "waist" between thorax and abdomen
  Often social insects with complex colonies

3.2 If the insect undergoes INCOMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS:
Order Hemiptera (True Bugs)
  Piercing-sucking mouthparts
  Wings may be partially hardened, folded flat over the back
  Includes aphids, stink bugs, and cicadas

Order Orthoptera (Grasshoppers, Crickets, Katydids)
  Large hind legs for jumping
  Chewing mouthparts
  Long antennae and often sound-producing organs

Order Odonata (Dragonflies, Damselflies)  
  Long, slender bodies with two pairs of transparent wings
  Aquatic nymphs (naiads) with gills
  Predatory at both larval and adult stages

Example of classification:
  Observation:
    Six legs, body in three segments
      Two pairs of scaled wings
      Long coiled mouthpart
      Develops through egg → larva (caterpillar) → pupa → adult
  Classification:
    Passes Step 1 → Insect
    Complete metamorphosis
    Scaled wings and larval caterpillar stage → Order Lepidoptera
