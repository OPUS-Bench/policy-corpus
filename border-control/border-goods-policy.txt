Conditions for Compliance
To ensure smooth entry into the country, imported goods must meet all of the following conditions.

1. Are the Goods Allowed?
Goods are not permitted to enter the country if they fall under the following categories:

All other goods are generally permitted, subject to proper documentation and compliance with other customs rules.

2. What Documents Are Required?
A commercial invoice is required if the total value of the shipment exceeds $1,000 USD.
An import license is required if the goods are legally classified as controlled items. This includes sensitive technologies, certain chemicals, and goods subject to trade restrictions.

Goods originating from the European Union that are not agricultural products benefit from a 0% duty rate under applicable trade agreements.
For all other goods, customs duties apply based on:

Shipments are subject to inspection if:
- The goods include electronics or luxury items
