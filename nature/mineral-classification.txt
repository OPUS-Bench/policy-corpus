Mineral Classification Policy
Policy Objective
To assign each identified mineral specimen to one of the established mineral classes based on observable, testable, or measurable properties including chemical composition, reaction behavior, physical characteristics, and environmental context.

Section 1: General Classification Rules
Rule 1 — Native Element Identification
Condition: The mineral consists of a single chemical element, without bonding to other elements.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Native Element.

Rule 2 — Sulfide Identification
Condition: The mineral exhibits metallic luster and produces a hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg) odor when in contact with acid.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Sulfide.

Rule 3 — Carbonate Identification
Condition: The mineral reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid by producing visible effervescence (CO₂ release).

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Carbonate.

Rule 4 — Halide Identification
Condition: The mineral has a salty or bitter taste, dissolves easily in water, and typically forms in evaporite environments.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Halide.

Rule 5 — Borate Identification
Condition: The mineral is soft (Mohs < 3), white to pale-colored, and occurs in arid environments.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Borate.

Rule 6 — Oxide Identification
Condition: The mineral does not react with acid, has high specific gravity, and consists of a metal bonded with oxygen.

Directive: Classify the specimen as an Oxide.

Rule 7 — Sulfate Identification
Condition: The mineral contains sulfur and oxygen (SO₄²⁻ group), may dissolve in water, and forms in evaporitic or sedimentary environments.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Sulfate.

Rule 8 — Phosphate Identification
Condition: The mineral contains phosphorus (PO₄³⁻ group), exhibits hexagonal or prismatic crystal habit, and does not react with acid.

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Phosphate.

Rule 9 — Silicate Identification
Condition: The mineral is hard (Mohs > 5), displays a vitreous luster, shows no acid reactivity, and is composed of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra (SiO₄).

Directive: Classify the specimen as a Silicate.

Rule 10 — Organic Mineral Identification
Condition: The mineral contains organic molecules and originates from biological or biochemical processes.

Directive: Classify the specimen as an Organic Mineral.

Section 2: Silicate Subclassification Policy
Rule 11 — Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)
Condition: The mineral contains isolated SiO₄ groups, without shared oxygen atoms between tetrahedra.

Directive: Classify as a Nesosilicate.

Rule 12 — Phyllosilicate (Sheet Structure)
Condition: The mineral forms sheets of tetrahedra with basal cleavage, and has platy or flaky habit.

Directive: Classify as a Phyllosilicate.

Rule 13 — Inosilicate (Chain Structure)
Condition: The mineral forms single or double chains of tetrahedra, and has prismatic or fibrous habit with distinct cleavage.

Directive: Classify as an Inosilicate.

Rule 14 — Tectosilicate (Framework Structure)
Condition: The mineral forms a three-dimensional network of SiO₄ tetrahedra with no cleavage and conchoidal fracture.

Directive: Classify as a Tectosilicate.
