Customer Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence Policy (CDD/EDD)

Scope
This policy applies to all transactions and business relationships managed by the institution, including operations involving crypto-assets, high-risk third countries, cash payments, and politically exposed persons (PEPs). It ensures compliance with AMLD6 and AMLR obligations across the EU.

1. When to Apply Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
CDD must be performed before executing a transaction or establishing a business relationship under the following circumstances:
- When a customer initiates a transaction that exceeds legally defined thresholds.
- When the customer is not previously known to the institution or lacks sufficient identification data.
For any crypto-asset transaction equal to or exceeding €1,000.
- When there is suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, regardless of the transaction amount.
- Whenever a business relationship is initiated, including onboarding of individual or corporate clients.

2. When to Apply Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
EDD procedures must be applied in addition to standard CDD when any of the following conditions are met:
- The customer is a politically exposed person (PEP) or closely associated with a PEP.
- The transaction involves a country classified as high-risk by the EU or the FATF.
- The customer qualifies as a high-net-worth individual, with wealth equal to or exceeding €50 million.
- The transaction involves the use of auto-hosted crypto wallets or a correspondent relationship between crypto-asset service providers across borders.

In these cases, the institution must collect and document the source of funds and wealth, conduct ongoing monitoring, and obtain senior management approval before proceeding.

3. Identity Verification Requirements
For individuals, the institution must verify the full name, date of birth, nationality, residential address, official government-issued ID, and a recent photograph.
For legal entities, it must verify the registered legal name, company registration number, address, legal structure, and the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs).
For trusts or fiduciary arrangements, the trust deed must be obtained along with identification details of the trustees, settlors, and beneficiaries, including the ownership and control structure.
For crypto-asset transactions equal to or exceeding €1,000, the origin and destination wallet addresses must be recorded, and identity verification must be completed. The purpose of the transaction must also be captured.

4. Timing and Retention
Identity verification and all CDD or EDD checks must be completed before account opening or transaction execution.
All records collected as part of due diligence must be securely retained for a minimum of five years after the end of the business relationship or the execution of the occasional transaction.
Due diligence information must be refreshed:
- At least every 12 months for high-risk customers.
- At least every 36 months for standard-risk customers.

Immediately when a red flag arises or if there is a significant change in the customer’s circumstances or ownership.

5. Automated Compliance Actions
The compliance system must automatically block or delay transactions when regulatory thresholds are exceeded until CDD is complete.
If a customer matches a PEP list or a financial sanctions list, the system must initiate enhanced due diligence protocols and notify the compliance officer.
For transactions involving high-risk countries, the system must enforce stricter monitoring and additional documentation requirements.
If a customer profile is incomplete or invalid, the system must prevent onboarding or transaction processing until all required data is collected and verified.
When discrepancies are detected between the internal beneficial ownership data and the official registry, a discrepancy report must be submitted to the competent authority within 14 calendar days. The report must include evidence of the divergence and a proposed correction if available.

6. Exceptions and Escalation
Any exception to CDD or EDD requirements must be approved by a designated senior compliance officer. No employee may override these controls without formal authorization.

If CDD cannot be completed or if there is reasonable suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, the case must be escalated to the institution’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for further investigation and potential filing of a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).
