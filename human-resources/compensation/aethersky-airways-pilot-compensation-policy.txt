AetherSky Airways Pilot Compensation Policy

1. Purpose
This policy outlines the compensation structure for flight crew members employed by AetherSky Airways. 
It aims to ensure competitive, transparent, and fair compensation practices in line with industry standards, regulatory requirements, and the collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the Pilot Union Council.

2. Compensation Structure
2.1 Base Pay
Pilot compensation is calculated primarily on a per-flight-hour basis. Pilots are paid based on their rank (First Officer or Captain) and the type of aircraft operated (narrow-body or wide-body). 
The base hourly rate reflects qualifications, operational responsibility, and market benchmarks. A minimum of 75 flight hours per month is guaranteed for all active pilots. 
Compensation is capped at 100 flight hours per month and 1,000 hours annually.
In addition to flight hours, compensation is provided for ground duty and mandatory training. Ground standby is compensated at a flat daily rate, and training sessions (including simulator time, recurrent checks, and safety briefings) are compensated at a separate daily rate.

2.2 Bonuses and Incentives
Newly hired pilots are eligible for a one-time signing bonus. First Officers receive $10,000, while Direct-Entry Captains receive $20,000, payable upon completion of probationary training.
Annual performance bonuses of up to 10% of total annual earnings are awarded based on key performance indicators such as safety record, punctuality, professional conduct, and feedback from flight operations. 
Additionally, a service-based retention bonus of $5,000 is issued for every three consecutive years of service.

3. Per Diem and Travel Allowances
Pilots are entitled to per diem payments to cover meals and incidental expenses while on duty away from their home base. The domestic per diem rate is set at $3.25 per hour and international assignments are compensated at $5.00 per hour. 
These rates are applied continuously from sign-in to release at base. Overnight accommodation and ground transportation are provided and arranged by the airline.

4. Schedule Premiums and Protections
Flight assignments on designated holidays are compensated at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate. Short-notice assignments issued within 48 hours of departure qualify for a premium payment of $250 per flight leg, in addition to the standard hourly compensation. 
Reserve callouts are compensated with a flat fee of $75, regardless of flight assignment, and are followed by regular hourly pay if flight duty is performed.

5. Leave and Time Off
Pilots accrue 15 days of paid vacation annually, with accrual increasing with seniority. In addition, each pilot is entitled to 10 paid sick days per calendar year. 
Emergency unpaid leave of up to five days may be granted under exceptional personal circumstances, with the option to apply banked paid time off toward such leave. All leave requests are subject to a bidding and seniority-based approval system.

6. Benefits
AetherSky Airways provides comprehensive health benefits, including medical, dental, and vision insurance. The company contributes 90% of the premiums. Pilots are also enrolled in a 401(k) retirement plan with a 6% employer match. 
Life insurance equivalent to twice the base annual salary is provided at no cost. The airline offers mental health support programs, including fatigue management consultations and confidential counseling. 
Travel benefits are extended to pilots and their immediate family members, including unlimited standby travel on all AetherSky flights and partner airline discounts.

7. Career Progression and Pay Increases
Pilot compensation increases annually based on seniority, performance, and role. Annual raises range from 2% to 5%. First Officers are eligible for promotion to Captain after completing a minimum of three years of service and 2,000 logged flight hours, subject to performance evaluations and operational needs. 
Upon promotion, pilots are automatically transitioned to the appropriate compensation tier.

8. Oversight and Compliance
All aspects of pilot compensation are subject to regular review and audit. The Pilot Compensation Oversight Committee conducts annual audits to ensure transparency and fairness. 
All changes in pay structure, benefits, or bonuses are communicated in writing and must be acknowledged electronically by the pilot.
