Here's a basic eligibility policy for car insurance that outlines the requirements an applicant must meet to qualify for coverage. This policy serves as a general guide and can be adapted based on specific insurer rules and regulations.

Applicant Age Requirements
The primary policyholder must be at least 18 years old.
Drivers under 18 must have a parent or guardian as the primary policyholder.
Drivers over the age of 75 may require additional medical assessments or driving tests.
Valid Driver’s License
All drivers listed on the policy must hold a valid driver’s license for the vehicle class being insured.
Licenses must be current, not expired, suspended, or revoked.
International drivers may need to provide additional documentation or proof of driving history.

Vehicle Eligibility
The vehicle must be registered in the name of the applicant or an immediate family member.
The vehicle must be used primarily for personal use (commuting, leisure). Commercial use may require a different type of policy.
The vehicle must pass any required safety inspections and meet the insurer’s age and condition criteria (typically, vehicles older than 20 years may not be covered).
Driving Record Requirements
The primary policyholder and all listed drivers must have a reasonably clean driving record.
A history of major violations (DUI, reckless driving) or multiple minor infractions (speeding, accidents) within the last 3-5 years may impact eligibility or lead to higher premiums.
Recent license suspensions or revocations may result in disqualification.

Insurance History
Applicants must provide details of their prior insurance coverage, including any lapses in coverage.
A history of insurance fraud, frequent claims, or policy cancellations due to non-payment may impact eligibility.
Residency and Vehicle Location
The applicant must reside in the country or state where the policy is issued and provide a valid address.The vehicle must be primarily garaged at the declared location. Out-of-country usage may require additional coverage.
Credit Score (where applicable)
Some insurers use credit scores as part of the eligibility assessment.Poor credit history may result in higher premiums or impact eligibility, subject to local regulations.

Usage Restrictions
Vehicles used for ridesharing, delivery services, or other commercial purposes may not be eligible under a standard personal auto policy.Modifications to the vehicle (e.g., performance enhancements) must be declared and may affect eligibility or coverage terms.
Minimum Insurance Requirements
The applicant must purchase at least the minimum liability coverage required by law in their state or country.Additional coverage options (collision, comprehensive) may be offered but are subject to the insurer’s approval based on eligibility criteria.

Important Disclosures
Policy Exclusions: Certain high-risk drivers or vehicles (e.g., high-performance sports cars, vehicles with a salvage title) may be excluded from standard coverage.
Premium Adjustments: Eligibility does not guarantee favorable premium rates; rates may be adjusted based on risk factors.”
